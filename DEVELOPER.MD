## The application

This is a simple timer with a progressbar (optional). It has functions for what will happen when the time is up (change color, alert or sound). And also optional functions for pause on hover and a warning when 10s left.

Ideas for enhancements and development:

- Functions for styling

- Different ways to display the time.

- Optional pause button
